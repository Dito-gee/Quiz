•	The header is responsive and each of the links and hamburger menu function as desired.

•	The javascript behaves as expected regardless of the device.

•	The social media links within the footer all work as expected on all pages, taking the user to the relevant link in a new tab.

•	The download cv button works

•	The phone and email links work

•	The contact link within the cover-text takes the user to the contact page when clicked.

•	On the contact page the form inputs and validation work as expected.

•	I used Lighthouse to test website. Results below:

#### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
##### User Goals
#### As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the named person’s profession.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice.

Underneath there is a content Hero with Text and a "DOWNLOAD MY CV" Call to action button.
    
The main points are made immediately with the content hero

#### As a user, I want to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid. At the top of the home page there are page heading links, each link describes a page and sends the user to the respective page when selected.

The user can navigate the website to learn more about the named person’s profession using the following options, i.e.  click the call-to-action button to download cv, or scroll down, or click the navbar links (home, about, portfolio, contact)

#### As a user, I want to know more about the named person’s knowledge, experience and skills in the painting and decorating profession. 
 
I want to be able to locate their social media links to learn more about them.

I want to be able to download a copy of their CV.

I want to be able to see pictorial evidence of work done.

#### As a user, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the named person.

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact " Page. Here they can fill out the form on the page. Alternatively, they can contact the person via social media, email or phone. 

The footer contains links to the named person’s Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as his email and phone number.

Email address and phone number can also be found in the header page.

Whichever link they click, it will be open in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

The email link is set up to automatically open your email app and autofill their email address in the "To" section.

The phone link is set to automatically open in your phone ready to make call.

### Further Testing

The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.

![Screenshot 2025-06-26 130924](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d13a9c75-f2d1-4a47-9a72-67ea5c6b70cd)

The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, tablet and mobile.

Testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

Friends were asked to review the site to point out any user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

Navigation from one page to another does not work properly when using the navigation links at the top of the home page. The pages would not start at the beginning when the navigation links were used. I therefore assumed the navigation links weren't working properly eg href="#portfolio">Portfolio .  I attempted to fix the bug by modifying the href attributes to include index.html#section paths, eg href="index.html#portfolio">Portfolio, without success. I reverted to the original code to prevent any issues.
